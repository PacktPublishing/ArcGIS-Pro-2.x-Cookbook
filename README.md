# ArcGIS Pro 2.x Cookbook
This is the code repository for [ArcGIS Pro 2.x Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/arcgis-pro-2x-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788299039), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
ArcGIS is Esri's catalog of GIS applications with powerful tools for visualizing, maintaining, and analyzing data. ArcGIS makes use of the modern ribbon interface and 64-bit processing to increase the speed and efficiency of using GIS. It allows users to create amazing maps in both 2D and 3D quickly and easily.

If you want to gain a thorough understanding of the various data formats that can be used in ArcGIS Pro and shared via ArcGIS Online, then this book is for you.

Beginning with a refresher on ArcGIS Pro and how to work with projects, this book will quickly take you through recipes about using various data formats supported by the tool. You will learn the limits of each format, such as Shapefiles, Geodatabase, and CAD files, and learn how to link tables from outside sources to existing GIS data to expand the amount of data that can be used in ArcGIS. You'll learn methods for editing 2D and 3D data using ArcGIS Pro and how topology can be used to ensure data integrity. Lastly the book will show you how data and maps can be shared via ArcGIS Online and used with web and mobile applications.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

In Database folder, there are five sub-folders. In AthensQuarry.gdb folder, there is one more sub-folder named a0000000c.gdbtable. From that folder, a0000000c.zip.001 needs to be unzipped using PeaZip.

Similarly, in Trippville_GIS.gdb folder, a00000048.gdbtable.zip needs to be unzipped.

The code will look like the following:
```
if (popden<=1335)
  {
  return "Low Density";
  }
else if (popden>1335&&popden<=1955)
  {
  return "Medium Density";
  }
else
  {
  return "High Density";
  }
```

This book assumes that the reader has at least some knowledge of ArcGIS Pro. It is recommended that you have read and worked through the exercises in the Learning ArcGIS Pro book by Packt Publishing or have previous real-world experience using ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap. 
You will need to have ArcGIS Pro 2.1 or later installed with a Standard or higher license along with a license for the 3D Analyst extension for ArcGIS Pro in order to complete all the recipes in this book. If you are limited to a basic license or don't have a 3D Analyst license, you will still be able to complete the majority of the recipes, just not all of them. 
You will need a username and a login password for ArcGIS Online with at least Publisher-level permissions. 
You will need to download and install the sample data files as instructed in the Download the example code files section. 
If you do not have a license for ArcGIS Pro, 3D Analyst extension, or ArcGIS Online, you can request a trial license from Esri at http://www.esri.com/arcgis/trial.
